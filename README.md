# packet-system
This is a simple abstract packet system that I created to experiment around with JS networking.

The samples can be found [here](https://github.com/yousef-essa/packet-system-sample).  
The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/yousef-essa/packet-system/wiki).

The packet-system can be installed via npm:
> npm install packet-system
